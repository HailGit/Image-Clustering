This work aims to conduct a comparative study between clustering algorithms in the field of image processing. In order to analyze the performance of the built-in algorithms, 3 built-in algorithms were selected and compared with 3 custom written algorithms. The built-in algorithms are K-Means, Spectral Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering, the custom written algorithms are K-Means, K-Medoids and Spectral Clustering.
